# Closed Loop Neurofeedback
Code for a closed loop EEG attention experiment.

Dependencies:
- Python
- Psychopy (https://www.psychopy.org/)
- MNE (https://mne-tools.github.io/stable/index.html) 
- Lab streaming layer (https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer)

Additionally a number of images must be available. For the face images we used the FERET database (https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/image-group/color-feret-database) and for the scene images we used the SUN database (https://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/SUN/).
